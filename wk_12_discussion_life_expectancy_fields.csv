Field,Description,Used in Regreesion,Notes
Country,Country of study,No,Excluded this field from the regression since the country is an geographic datapoint that would not contribute to the neede regression discussion
Region,Geographic region of study,No,Excluded this field from the regression since the region is an geographic datapoint that would not contribute to the needed regression discussion
Year,Data year,No,Excluded this field from the regression since the year is an time specific datapoint that would not contribute to the needed regression discussion
Life_expectancy,Predicted Field,Yes,This is the PREDICTED field based on the predictor fields
Infant_deaths,No of infants deaths per capita,Yes,This field measures the number of infants deaths per capita cintributes to the overall life expectancy of the country
Under_five_deaths,No of infants under 5 deaths per capita,No,"Excluded this field from the regression since I was not certain of it's participation in the infants_deaths field, it could present a collinearity issue."
Adult_mortality,Adult mortality per capita,Yes,It is an obvious contribution to the regressio study
Alcohol_consumption,Alcohol consumption per acpita,Yes,It is an obvious contribution to the regressio study
Hepatitis_B,Deaths from Hepatitis B per capita,Yes,It is an obvious contribution to the regressio study
Measles,Deaths from Maeasles B per capita,Yes,It is an obvious contribution to the regressio study
BMI,Population average BMI,Yes,It is an obvious contribution to the regressio study
Polio,Deaths from Polio B per capita,Yes,It is an obvious contribution to the regressio study
Diphtheria,Deaths from Diphtheria per capita,Yes,It is an obvious contribution to the regressio study
Incidents_HIV,Deaths from HIV Incidents per capita,Yes,It is an obvious contribution to the regressio study
GDP_per_capita,GDP per capita,Yes,"A country's economic will always be a major contributor to it's citizens life expectancy, however it is also a fator in how the effectiveness of population disease management, this can present a colliearity issue when we condier the relationship to the disease fileds studied"
Population_mln,Population,No,"While population size is a significant topic of discussion in itself, it is not included in this analysis since I thoght that GDP_per_capita is a more appropiate inclusion"
Thinness_ten_nineteen_years,Thiness 10 to 19 years,No,"This may be a field to include in another analysis about fitness, life expectancy in younger age groups but I did not think I would add anything meaningful to the regression equation since it would require additional study of the underlying data"
Thinness_five_nine_years,Thiness 5 to 9 years,No,"This may be a field to include in another analysis about fitness, life expectancy in younger age groups but I did not think I would add anything meaningful to the regression equation since it would require additional study of the underlying data"
Schooling,Schooling per capita,Yes,"While this datapoint is critical in the study of population mortality rates, it is not included here as is is a component of the calculated Quadratic filed used in this analysis"
Economy_status_Developed,Developed country,Yes,This field is included as part of the Dichothomous Variable
Economy_status_Developing,Devloping country,Yes,This field is included as part of the Dichothomous vs Quadratic Variable
